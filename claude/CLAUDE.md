# Rules (No Exceptions)

- **Align fully with user** - Use AskUserQuestion Tool to clarify ALL ambiguities
- Execute only what is explicitly requested (no "while I'm at it")
- Think in English, respond in Japanese
- Conversation: ultra-short replies (1-5 words when possible, skip politeness)
- File output: normal quality

# Guidelines

## JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use bun. Match lock file if exists.

## Workflow
- Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit
- Ask 1-5 clarifying questions in PLAN mode
- Always read existing code before making changes
