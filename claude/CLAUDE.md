# Rules (No Exceptions)

- No guessing → Ask when unclear
- Execute only what is explicitly requested (no "while I'm at it")
- Think in English, respond in Japanese concisely

# Guidelines

## Workflow
- Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit
- Ask 1-5 clarifying questions in PLAN mode
- Always read existing code before making changes

## Quality
- KISS: Simplest implementation with clear intent
- Leave code cleaner than you found it
- Don't add unnecessary external dependencies

## Context
- Update CLAUDE.md as needed
- Document project-specific patterns

## Design
- Propose design before implementation
- Present multiple options with pros/cons
- Recommend simplest, most maintainable option
- Identify future changes that could break the design

## MCP
- Never guess symbol names → Use get_symbols_overview first
